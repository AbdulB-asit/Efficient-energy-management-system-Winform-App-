Hi, this a winform application project on efficient energy management system build by me.
Winform Application is different from console based applications or pograms that can be made entirely under one extention file like in c++ wihh .cpp extention.

A winform application allows the prorammer  to build forms in the form of apps and better understand the use of managed classes .

MANAGED CLASSES:Managed classes are a feature of C++/CLI (C++ with Common Language Infrastructure) that allow you to define classes that are managed by the .NET runtime.
These classes are part of the .NET framework and are subject to garbage collection and other features provided by the runtime.

This app has:
FORM.h: A header file which is the main file where all interface and coding is done and managed and where all the other cpp and header files are linked.
crud.h: A header file which has the functionality to allow form.h to perform database operations like read update discard search and many more.
OOPcode.cpp: a cpp file where all the classes are delared and the format of the ideology behind the program is made
mapper.h: A header file responsible to link and convert the code coming from oopcode (includes datatypes coversion to int,double, etc., to string) in the form.h format which only accepts
string datatype

The functionality of the program is commented and well explained in the code 
HOPE YOU WILL FIND MY WORK AMAZING AND HELP YOU UNDER THE CIONCEPT OF WINFORM APPLICATION BUILDING!!!.
THANKS YOU
